### Purpose and scope of this Application
This is a terminal application for a simple, single player Sugorouku Game created using Ruby programming language. Sugoroku is a Japanese name for a type of board games where players move around a board by rollong the dice. The board panels that players land on will often have tasks or activities that adds entertainment to the game. In most Sugoroku, the goal of the game is to reach the finish line with fewer number of turns or with the highest score.  

I have created the Sugoroku with the desire to learn more about Ruby programming, and to build an applciation that was interactive, fun and visually entertaining.

For this CLI Sugoroku Application, I created a Sugoroku Game where each panel will give players certain number of points. The aim of this game will be to reach the finish line with the highest score possible. Scores are compared by a ranking system that will show top 100 scores submitted to your local game file.
